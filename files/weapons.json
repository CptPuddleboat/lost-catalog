In place of a short-range wide-pattern blast of superheated plasma, the Brontes instead utilizes a supercapacitive gas mixture to store and maintain a charge, which is then launched with high-precision electro-magnetic rails. High-voltage operation is possible, especially when supplied by Harrison-brand mech reactors."
