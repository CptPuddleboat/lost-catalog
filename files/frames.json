    "description": "Deep at the core of IPS-N paradigms is an ideology of reused tech. Many of its projects, including the Kidd and Zheng licenses, can trace their roots to ramshackle projects built by very small people to solve very small problems. Unlike the Caliban, a machine built for a galaxy-wide purpose, IPS-N’s fundamental principle has always been that people will build what they need, whether we build it for them or not.<br>Following this mantra, the IPS-N Davy owes most of its fundamental structure and capability to the Lamprey-pattern deep-space refueling rig, a bulky, all-purpose frame designed to maneuver huge canisters of fuel to starship liners, both on the ground, and in zero-g. Engineers soon realized the frame was so generally solid, so responsive and versatile despite its size, that it could perform more generally as a load-carrier and cargo frame. This came even more to a head when reports arose of modified versions of the frame being used to fend off pirates in the Long Rim. Eventually, IPS-N bought the schematics for one of the more popular modification packages from a freight company that had been operating in that dark area of space, and began selling the Davy, a full-package license based on these edited designs.",

Their worlds are mighty and vast, a testament to human ingenuity and determination, and an endless test of the boundaries for what we may become. Humans across the galaxy have homes on distant planets, and mighty armies array to fight and conquer the land, sea, and sky.<br>But where others might own the ground they walk on, IPS-N owns the stars.<br>For centuries, their services have been the means by which these colonies are born. No supply ship passes any vast distance without an IPS-N hand being involved, not if it wishes to arrive in one piece, or at all. No journey is too long, or hard, or dangerous.<br>But the recent rumor is that journeys will be a thing of the past. SSC has experiemented with commercialized military-fielded blink tech with their Mourning Cloak line, and extracted Volador technology has leaped Armory understanding of the blink forward by several decades. Their prototype vessels have been sighted along the Dawnline and beyond, in the Long Rim, appearing and disappearing, without need or want of blink gates. And of course, there is the limited field-test of the Sunzi.<br>The Ulysses is IPS-N’s answer. A proof that they are game to play catch-up in this fight for celestial dominance.

    "description": "There are strange rumors about the origins of the Will-O’-Wisp pattern group. Arguably, it does not match the typical structure of HORUS’s mechanized combat chassis lineup, and is in fact more akin to its hardsuit options. However, due to its dense structure and extremely complex system architecture, alongside its marked capability in cavalry-tasked combat, it has been associated more closely with the former. As a fact, it is equipped with most of the features of a modern frame, including a cold-fusion reactor, powered motive assistance, weapon mounting hardware, and some extremely basic armor. However, its primary feature is its curious method by which it engages in combat.<br>The Will-O’-Wisp utilizes its enormous processing power to project a memetic construct around its wearer, the nature and look of which changes from frame-to-frame. To biological observers, this construct appears relatively translucent, but the effect is especially convincing when viewed through the sensors of modern machines of war. This construct can effectively interact with observers in a method similar to the BASILISK, but with a much more refined purpose than simply causing various instances of internal and psychological trauma. The construct invariably features one of three weapons, which it can change at will, and attacks with these weapons can affect the mind of biologicals and the sensors of mechanicals so strongly that they supply the resulting trauma of their own accord. Brains and onboard computing systems willingly shut down vital functions in either case in the belief of the reality of the damage. This unusual method of combat is, admittedly, less useful against biological targets, as proven by the incomplete and hazy projection, but it is still enough for UIB to classify the Will-O’-Wisp as a paracausal weapon, utilizing dangerous anticognitive technology.<br>Though, like all PGs, each sighting of a frame is different, all printcode associated with it contains an inordinate number of comments, from what most people believe are at least three distinct authors. In these comments are scattered musings on various topics surrounding the curious operation of the frames, esoteric and unhelpful in their nature, failing to shed light on exact technology, and instead providing commentary on philosophy and belief. These authors are identified by UIB as ‘little’, ‘Normal’, and ‘BIG’, their codenames referencing their distinct writing patterns. Most agents agree that it is likely these individuals are NHPs.",

It operates as a more control-oriented application of the Armory’s patented Tachyon Loop technology. There are many applications of the FTL particles, typically offensive, as in the case of the tachyon lance, and defensive, as with the Saladin and its tachyon shield.

Every now and again, however, something leaks, an experimental design believed to be novel by a researcher, extracted from the tank, and then forgotten. Even in these cases, the design may never be released to the world at large. But very rarely, something slips out.<br>The Garcia is one of these ‘tank-leaks’, as the Armory has called them. Rather than being released and licensed as a full, legally purchasable package, it is available only in corners of the dark omninet, where illicit goods are bought and sold. It has garnered some attention in recent years, seeing use in sectors near the Dawnline where Horus cults are a more common occurrence, but so far, Harrison Armory have made consistent efforts to hide and hush up all traces of the license, lest it be traced back to the secret of their massive research and development behemoth.",
